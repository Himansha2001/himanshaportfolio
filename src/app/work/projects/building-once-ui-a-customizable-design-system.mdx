## Overview

Development of a dynamic and user-friendly task marketplace platform, Servix, designed to connect users who need tasks completed with freelancers ready to bid on gigs. The platform focuses on simplicity, transparency, and efficiency, enabling users to post tasks, receive bids, and select the right service provider seamlessly.



## Key Features

- User Registration & Profiles: Implemented secure user authentication, allowing users to create detailed profiles as either task posters or service providers.
- Task Posting & Bidding System: Developed a streamlined system where users can post tasks with descriptions, budgets, and deadlines, while freelancers can place competitive bids.
- Real-Time Notifications: Integrated WebSockets for instant updates on new tasks, bid placements, and status changes, ensuring seamless communication between users.
- Review & Rating System: Introduced a feedback mechanism, allowing users to rate each other after task completion, fostering transparency and credibility within the platform.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: For building a fast, server-rendered front-end.
- Node.js & Express.js: For creating a robust back-end API.
- AWS: As the primary database for managing user data, tasks, and bids.
- WebSockets: To facilitate real-time communication and instant notifications.
- Figma: For wireframing, prototyping, and UI/UX design.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the major challenges was implementing a real-time bidding system while ensuring data consistency and user security. Leveraging WebSockets helped maintain real-time updates, but required careful synchronization with the database. Another key learning was balancing user simplicity with platform flexibility, ensuring that both task posters and service providers had seamless user flows without compromising on features.

## Outcome

Servix has streamlined the task-posting and gig-finding process, reducing friction between users and freelancers. The platform has enabled faster task completions, transparent bidding processes, and a secure environment for both parties. The scalable architecture also allows for future feature additions, setting the foundation for continuous growth and user engagement.
